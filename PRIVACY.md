# FitGenius Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 24, 2025

FitGenius (“the App”) is developed by Michael Coulter. This policy explains our approach to privacy and your responsibilities while using FitGenius.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 No Data Collection
FitGenius does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All workout selections, routines, and preferences remain on your device. We do not maintain servers, cloud backups, or analytics services for the App.

### 1.2 Third-Party Content
Exercise demonstrations are embedded from YouTube. When you load a video, YouTube may collect usage data under Google’s Privacy Policy. You can choose not to play the video or open it directly on YouTube.

## 2. Data Usage & Storage
Because no data leaves your device, we do not process, analyze, or share any user information. The App operates entirely offline for data storage purposes.

## 3. Suitability
FitGenius is intended for users of all ages. However, exercise routines should be performed with caution, and we recommend consulting a qualified professional before starting any new workout regimen.

## 4. Safety Notice
FitGenius provides exercise videos for instructional purposes only. Use the App at your own risk. Listen to your body, exercise within your capabilities, and stop immediately if you experience pain or discomfort. We are not liable for injuries or health issues that may arise from using the App.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
Because we do not collect personal data and the App is designed for general audiences, we comply with children’s privacy guidelines by default. Parents or guardians should supervise minors during exercise.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Updates will be reflected in the “Last updated” date and published at the same URL.

## 7. Contact Us
